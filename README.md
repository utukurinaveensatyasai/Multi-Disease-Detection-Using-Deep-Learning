# Multi-Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Introduction
The **Multi-Disease Detection Using Deep Learning** project aims to develop a system that can accurately detect multiple diseases from medical images using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of medical images and utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify diseases efficiently.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a deep learning model for detecting multiple diseases.
- Improve the accuracy of disease classification using CNN architectures.
- Provide a web-based interface for doctors and researchers to upload images and receive predictions.
- Ensure the system is scalable and efficient for real-world applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch
- **Web Framework**: Flask/Django (for API and UI integration)
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Dataset**: Publicly available medical image datasets (e.g., Chest X-ray, Skin Disease Images)

## ⚙️ Installation Guide
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps to Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multi-disease-detection.git
cd multi-disease-detection

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Use
### 1. Train the Model
```bash
python train.py
```
- This script will train the deep learning model using the specified dataset.

### 2. Test the Model
```bash
python test.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```
- This will load the trained model and predict the disease in the given image.

### 3. Run the Web Application
```bash
python app.py
```
- Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- Upload an image and get disease predictions.

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: Achieved ~90% accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluated using standard classification metrics.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzed for misclassification trends.
